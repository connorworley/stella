あのね　2つ目のバースデイ
選べるのなら　どうか今日にして
旅立つ私　見送るみたいな
海の碧さよ

ano ne futatsu me no BA-SUDEI
eraberu no nara douka kyou ni shite
tabidatsu watashi miokuru mitai na
umi no aosa yo

Hey, the second birthday.
If I could choose, it would somehow be today.
As I embarked upon my journey, it seemed as if   (? Kind of awkward and verbose.)
The blueness of the sea was bidding me farewell. (? ↑ pt. 2)

あれから約束通り　夢の在りか
探し迷った日もあったけど
あなたに誉められたくて

arekara yakusoku doori yume no arika
sagashi mayotta hi mo atta kedo
anata ni homeraretakute

There were days when I was lost searching for
What you promised, that place inside your dreams
But even still, you praised me.                     (? ほめられたくて ???）

悩み歩き続けた日々
どんなことも尊いプレゼント
「負けるな」　たった4文字の
あなたのメール　忘れずにいるから
人ごみをすり抜け　私　見つけてよね

Nayami aruki tsuketa hibi
donna koto mo toutoi PURESENTO
"Ma Ke Ru Na" tatta yon moji no
anata no meeru wasurezuni iru kara
hitogomi wo surinuke watashi mitsuketeyone

In those days, admist my sorrow, I continued to walk
And no matter what, it was a valuable present
"Don't you give up." Merely those four words,
Inside that mail. Because I kept them close to me,   (? better translation for "Wasurezuni iru kara")
Stumbling through the crowd, I found it, didn't I?   (? Mitsukete, not Mitsuketa)

どうして溢れてくるのだろう　
うれしいのに涙が止まらない
さよなら　昨日の私へ　
さあ飛び立とう　見失うことはない
あなたという羅針盤　心にある限り

doushite afuretekuru no darou 
ureshii noni namida ga tomaranai
sayonara kinou no watashi he
saa tobitatou miushinau koto ha nai
anata toiu rashinban 
kokoro ni aru kagari

Why are they overflowing?
Even though I'm happy, the tears won't stop.
Goodbye to the me of yesterday.
Now, let's fly away! There's nothing that we've overlooked.
You'll be my guiding compass,
As long as you're in my heart.
